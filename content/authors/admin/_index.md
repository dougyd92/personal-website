Iâ€™m a software engineer with a passion for robotics, computer vision, and building systems that interact with the real world. 
I also have an interest in education and making coding accessible to all.

I currently work at Amazon Robotics, where I develop software that manages and coordinates fleets of autonomous mobile robots across global fulfillment centers. 

With over 9 years of experience as a backend software engineer, I have contributed to teams at companies big and small. 
At Facebook, I trained machine learning models to fight spam and other forms of abuse, using data from billions of users.
At Codecademy, I was a leader in the engineering organization and established development practices as we tripled in size.

After years as a generalist, I pursued a graduate degree to specialize in robotics and AI. I'm now seeking opportunities where I can apply that expertise to meaningful, technically challenging problemsâ€”whether in advanced robotics, computer vision, or mission-driven tech that makes a positive impact.
