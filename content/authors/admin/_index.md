I am looking for my next role as a robotics software engineer or a computer vision researcher.

I have over 8 years experience working as a backend software engineer at companies big and small. 
At Facebook, I trained machine learning models to fight spam and other forms of abuse, using data from billions of users.
At Codecademy, I was a leader in the engineering organization and established development practices as we tripled in size.

Having been a generalist for most of my career, I entered graduate school in order to specialize into the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence.
